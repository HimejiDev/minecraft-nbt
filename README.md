# Minecraft NBT Scripts 💾

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** I am not planning to make anymore NBT scripts.

Hey, what's up peeps! 👋

> I used to run a [Minecraft NBT Discord server](https://discord.gg/J8aMZRhEEv), I was passionate about sharing my own NBT scripts with the community. It was a space where Minecraft enthusiasts could share their knowledge and learn from each other. However, due to my mental health, I had to step back from actively participating in the server. Additionally, Mojang's patching of NBTs made it challenging to make anymore NBTs, and I found it difficult to maintain the server's integrity. As a result, I made the difficult decision to make the server read-only, where members could still access the information, but no new scripts would be added. I host the "scripts" here on discord so I could easily update them.
